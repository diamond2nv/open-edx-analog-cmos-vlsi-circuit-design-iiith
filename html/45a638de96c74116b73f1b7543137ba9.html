<p align="justify">In this experiment, we study an interesting combination of differential pairs and current mirrors that proves useful in many applications. To arrive at the circuit, let us first address a problem encountered in some cases. Recall that the op amps have a differential input but a single-ended output. Thus, the internal circuits of such op amps must incorporate a stage that &ldquo;converts&rdquo; a differential input to a single-ended output. We may naturally consider the topology shown in Figure as a candidate for this task.</p>
