<p align="justify">As seen in the experiment on common source with resistive load, the trade-off between the voltage gain and the voltage headroom can be relaxed by replacing the load resistor with a current source. The observations therefore suggest the use of a PMOS device as the load of an NMOS CS amplifier as in Fig. A.</p>
