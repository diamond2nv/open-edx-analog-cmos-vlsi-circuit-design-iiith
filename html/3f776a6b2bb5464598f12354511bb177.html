<p align="justify">In some applications, we may use a diode-connected MOSFET as the drain load. Illustrated in Fig. (a), such a topology exhibits only a moderate gain due to the relatively low impedance of the diode-connected device. With &lambda; = 0, M2 acts as a small-signal resistance equal to 1/gm2.</p>
