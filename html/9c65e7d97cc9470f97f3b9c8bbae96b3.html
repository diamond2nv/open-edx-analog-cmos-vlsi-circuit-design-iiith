<p align="justify">Shown in Fig. (a), the CG topology. Here, if the input rises by a small value, &Delta;V , then the gate-source voltage of M1 decreases by the same amount, thereby lowering the drain current by gm &Delta;V and raising Vout by gm &Delta;V RD. That is, the voltage gain is positive and equal to</p>
