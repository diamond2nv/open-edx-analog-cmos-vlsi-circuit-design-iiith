<p>The objective of this lab is to provide an interface and train a novice circuit designer towards analog CMOS design.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lab explains the design of analog CMOS circuits starting from specifications, design and simulation.</li>
<li>The lab presents the basic analog building blocks and circuit topologies design and characterization.</li>
<li>Design variables are highlighted and variations in signal swings, bandwidth and gain are characterized.</li>
