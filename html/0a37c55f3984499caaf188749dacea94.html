<p align="justify">The elegant concept of &ldquo;differential&rdquo; signals and amplifiers was invented in the 1940s and first utilized in vacuum-tube circuits. Since then, differential circuits have found increasingly wider usage in microelectronics and serve as a robust, high-performance design paradigm in many of today&rsquo;s systems. This introduction describes bipolar and MOS differential amplifiers and formulates their large-signal and small-signal properties.</p>
