<p align="justify">Cascoding can also be realised with MOSFETs so as to increase the output impedance of a current source. Illustrated in Fig. a, the idea is to replace the degeneration resistor with a MOS current source, thus presenting a small-signal resistance of rO2 from X to ground. It can now be written as</p>
