<p align="justify">The MOS counterpart of the emitter follower is called the &ldquo;source follower&rdquo; (or the &ldquo;common drain&rdquo; stage) and shown in Fig. The amplifier senses the input at the gate and produces the output at the source, with the drain tied to VDD. The circuit&rsquo;s behavior is similar to that of the bipolar counterpart.</p>
