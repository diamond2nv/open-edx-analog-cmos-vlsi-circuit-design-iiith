<p>The procedure for doing the experiments is as follows:<br /> Step 1: Draw the schematic of the circuit topology with default values of different parameters. Please select the component and then drag and drop.<br /> <img src="http://cse30-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/vlab3/myExp7_b/diff_to_single.png" /> Step 2: Please go through the introduction and theory, understand the basic motivation behind the topology.<br /> Step 3: Fix your specifications and do hand calculations based on the design equations given for the circuit.<br /> Step 4: Change the default values on the schematic based on the design calculations carried out in Step. 3.<br /> Step 5: Press the simulation button and see the graph in a separate tab.Vary different design parameters and understand the variations in bandwidth, gain, signal swing etc.<br /> Step 6: Verify your results to match with the target specifications of Step. 3.</p>
